Hello there, and welcome to my website! 

I'm a first-year PhD student at the Paris School of Economics, writing a thesis entitled "Essays on Migration". Accordingly, my main field is in migration with wide-ranging within-subject interests. 

I am supervised by professors [Hillel Rapoport](https://sites.google.com/view/hillel-rapoport) and [David Margolis](https://www.parisschoolofeconomics.eu/en/people/david-margolis/).
