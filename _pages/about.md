Hello there, and welcome to my website! 

I'm a second-year PhD student at the Paris School of Economics, writing a thesis entitled "Essays on Migration". Accordingly, my main field is migration with wide-ranging within-subject interests. I am particularly interested in immigrant integration in rich countries, but I have a strong penchant for historical migration and political economy too.

In the academic year 2025-2026 I will be co-organizing the [Applied Economics Lunch Seminar](https://www.parisschoolofeconomics.eu/en/events/applied-economics-lunch/). Feel free to contact me, [Marta Pinzan](https://www.parisschoolofeconomics.eu/en/persons/marta-pinzan/), or [Louis Margolis](https://www.parisschoolofeconomics.eu/en/persons/louis-margolis/) for any inquiries.

I am also co-organizing the [Little Informal Seminar (PSI-PSE)](https://www.parisschoolofeconomics.eu/en/events/paris-school-of-economics-informal-seminar/) at PSE. You can inquire about presentation slots at [psipseseminar@gmail.com](mailto:psipseseminar@gmail.com).

I am supervised by professors [Hillel Rapoport](https://sites.google.com/view/hillel-rapoport) and [David Margolis](https://www.parisschoolofeconomics.eu/en/people/david-margolis/).
