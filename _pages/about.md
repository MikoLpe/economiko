Hello there, and welcome to my website! 

I'm a first-year PhD student at the Paris School of Economics, writing a thesis entitled "Essays on Migration". Accordingly, my main field is in migration, but I am also interested in labour and public economics as well as econometrics. For now, I have two types of research, with the first using Nordic registry data to study immigrant integration in Finland and Sweden, and the second one studies the gendered dimension of historical migrant sorting from Canada to the US during the Age of Mass Migration. I am supervised by professors [Hillel Rapoport](https://sites.google.com/view/hillel-rapoport) and [David Margolis](https://www.parisschoolofeconomics.eu/en/people/david-margolis/).

The rest of the site, CV, publications, blog (?), is as much a work in progress as my thesis.
